          <h1>About me!</h1>
          <h3>My name is <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>Omkaar Shenoy</span> and I am a <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>computer science</span> student at Arizona State University. My focus is on <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>software engineering, data analysis, and machine learning</span>, and I have also participated in various outside-of-class projects and organizations. I am <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>passionate about creating innovative solutions</span> that make a positive impact on society and am always looking for new opportunities to grow and learn.  

<br/><br/>

As a Computer Science student, I <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>enjoy building software </span> that makes lives easier.  Whether it's a new app that streamlines a tedious process or a website that provides valuable information clearly and concisely,  I believe <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>user experience is the most important part of a product </span>. I love the challenge of creating something useful and user-friendly. I have always been fascinated by the <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>power of data </span>and its ability to help us understand the world around us. That's why <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>I love data visualization </span>and the art of turning complex data sets into something easy for people to understand. <br/><br/>


This past summer, I had the privilege of <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>interning at National Public Radio </span>, a fantastic experience that enhanced my expertise and abilities. It was an incredible experience that <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>solidified my love for all things tech</span>. Working alongside experienced professionals and contributing to high-impact projects gave me <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>valuable insights into the industry </span>and helped me to develop my skills and knowledge even further. I am eager to continue learning and developing my skills as a computer science professional, and <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>I look forward to all the exciting opportunities </span> that lie ahead.
<br/><br/>
When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you can find me <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>chilling with friends</span>, sampling new <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>coffee shops </span>, and spending time outdoors, such as going on <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>hikes</span> or simply appreciating the <span style={{color:'white', fontWidth:'900px  '}}>Arizona sunshine</span>.</h3>
